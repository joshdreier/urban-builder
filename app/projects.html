                <h2>Cole Valley Spanish-Colonial</h2>
                <p>This project was a collaboration between The Urban Builder, interior designer Adrian Dagli at Interior Wanderer, architect Kevin Maxey with KMD and the homeowners. Nestled on a quiet street in Cole Valley, the house had been renovated in the past with decorative terracotta tiled floors, Mexican accent tiles on the stairs, and dark stained oak doors and trim to give it a Spanish-Colonial feel. The clients wanted to continue that theme but modernize the space and create a better flow throughout the house. This involved extensive structural work to close up a centrally located lightwell and prepare for a future roof deck to take advantage of the views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Four large skylights located in the center of the kitchen fill the space with natural light throughout the day, which helps accentuate the colors and textures of the various finishes. <a href="https://www.homesandgardens.com/kitchens/this-bright-kitchen-remodel-gives-original-features-a-new-chance-to-shine" target="_blank"><u>Featured in Homes & Gardens</u></a>, the end result is a light-filled house that feels both modern and timeless.</p>

                <h2>Lake Street Luxury</h2>
                <p>The Urban Builder has always focused on cohesive and long lasting contractor/client collaborations. This project on Lake Street was the third renovation project we performed with this client and the most ambitious in scope and design. With help of Michael Tauber Architecture, the goal was to transform an outdated home and elevate it to a level befitting its high-end location in Presidio Terrace. The house required a significant amount of structural foundation and framing work that involved excavating down on the ground level and extending the rear part of the house further into the back yard. Custom windows and doors are just one highlight when viewing the exterior of the house and are accentuated by the new shingle siding and terrazzo staircase at the front facade. For the interior, each room was meticulously designed and curated by the owner to achieve a beautiful aesthetic &#150; from the style of moulding to the custom casework, wall coverings, stonework and lighting &#150; all were combined with extraordinary results. Work was briefly slowed by the pandemic, but with the combined efforts of a dedicated team of trades people, the end result is a showpiece home that will stand the test of time.</p>

                <h2>Corona Heights Contemporary</h2>

                <p>This project was a collaboration between The Urban Builder, TC Studio architecture and inspired clients with the goal to transform a modest mid-century home into a stunning light filled modern residence. Like most full house renovations we gutted the interior and exterior of the building, re-framed the space to create open floor plans and stairways, and updated the house with all new electrical, plumbing and radiant heat. It was during the finishing phase that the real transformation began to happen. From the custom casework fabricated by SF based Kenwood Cabinetry to the imported large format Spanish tile, each detail was painstakingly thought through by all involved and installed by expert craftsmen. The site offers incredible views of the city that can be appreciated at every level.  A roof deck is accessible by climbing an interior staircase up through a large rolling skylight, which allows natural light to pour through the house for dramatic effect.</p>

                <h2>Inner Richmond Classic</h2>

                <p>The potential was always there for this inner Richmond home, but it had never been realized until now. The original floor plan had been modified at some point in the past to become a disjointed layout. Our project involved a new floor plan that flowed seamlessly among rooms into a new three story horizontal addition at the back of the building. High end modern appliances, custom casework throughout and top of the line smart home features were combined with finish details to reflect the original era of the home. The end result was a classic SF home built for the modern times that we live in.</p>

                <h2>Glen Park Modern</h2>

                <p>This house had an awkward layout with an exterior staircase connecting the upper living space to storage rooms and the garage below. The new design enclosed the exterior staircase and combined the storage space and the living space into a spacious single family home. Steel beams on the top floor allowed for an open floor plan between the kitchen, dining room and living room. A large kitchen island acts as the focal point of the newly opened space. Beautiful 5” wide Oak Rift and Quartered flooring and stair treads, stainless steel framed glass stair railings, cement and porcelain tiled bathrooms and custom cabinetry show the modern touches that are incorporated throughout the house.</p>

                <p>Located just one block from Ocean Beach this project involved an extensive renovation of the interior and an addition to the back of the house to include a new master suite. A complete structural upgrade with steel beams allowed us to strengthen the existing structure while creating an open floor plan. A new staircase was added from the garage to the upper two levels to create a great flow throughout the house. Custom trim on each level combined original Victorian trim details on the main level with a modern look in the addition.</p>

                <h2>Sherwood Forest Modern</h2>

                <p>The project involved removing the interior walls between the kitchen, dining room and living room into an open floor plan with a full bath and laundry closet on the main level. Wide plank T&amp;G oak flooring was also added to the main level to compliment the new custom Bamboo cabinetry and gray Quartz countertops. On the second floor the en suite master bathroom includes a walk in shower with beautiful tile work, a floating vanity and back lit mirror. Sweeping views of Sutro heights and the newly landscaped yard below can be enjoyed from the cantilevered deck with a glass railing.</p>
